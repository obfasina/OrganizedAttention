Included are scripts for 1) the questionnaire algorithm 2) the paraproduct decomposition. 
The 2D questionnaire algorithm organizes a matrix to be mixed Holder, allowing one to subsequently apply the paraproduct decomposition.
The 3D questionnaire algorithm is used for network 3-tensor organization; one can then compute expansion coefficients of the network 3-tensor with respect to the Haar bases supported on the indices of the tensor axes.
'txl_vit_paraproduct_decompositions.ipynb' is an example of the paraproduct decompostion implementation for the transformer-xl and vit b-16 networks
'txl_vit_tensor_organizations.ipynb' is an example notebook for organization of the attention heads for the transformer-xl and vit b-16 networks
