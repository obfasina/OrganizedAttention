pyquest: diffusion analysis of questionnaires.

Aug. 2017
-----------
This version of pyquest includes: 
* averaging and difference tree transforms 
* multi-tree EMD 
* data-driven weighted EMD
* bi-haar coherency measure
* sparse affinity matrices (untested)
Added files:
* transform.py
* tree_transforms.ipynb (jupyter notebook demonstrating tree transforms)

A Matlab implementation can be found at https://github.com/gmishne/InformedGeometry-CoupledPendulum

TODO: add demo demonstrating multi-tree EMD and bi-organization local refinement


Aug. 2016
-----------
This version of pyquest includes tri-geometric analysis.
Updated files:
* dual_affinity.py
* plot_utils.py
* questionnaire.py
* tree.py
and a new IPython notebook:
* JSTSP.ipynb
